# A simple PDF parser for Deutsche Bahn tickets

This crude python-script will traverse through a folder and try to parse all its pdfs to extract useful information from digital DB-tickets into a csv for your tax report.

No commandline options. Just run it in the folder containing your receipts and it will output to output.csv in the same folder.
